## The vault password file

This playbook uses [Ansible Vaults](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html). The password file, GPG encryped and shared amongst Le DÃ©tour admins by an out-of-band mean of communication, is expected to be named `.vault_password.gpg` in this cloned repo root folder.

## Install Ansible dependencies

Install community package for creating and using roles:

```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml

# TODO: When Ansible 2.10 is released, this should be enough
# ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```

## Production mode

```sh
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

This `playbook.yml` will setup all machines described in `hosts` according to the configuration described in `/roles`. 

## First setup of a production machine

1. Install debian 10 (buster)
2. Full disk encryption
3. Add a single user `debian`
4. Ensure openssh server is running
5. `ssh-copy-id` for the user / machine ansible will be ran from
6. Install `sudo`: `apt install sudo`
6. Configure user `debian` for passwordless sudo. Create a new file `/etc/sudoers.d/admin` with this content: `debian ALL = NOPASSWD: ALL`
7. Run ansible against a first time with the LAN IP of the machine. This will bootstrap the Wireguard connection that will be used by default next time: `ansible-playbook -e "ansible_host=[LAN IP] ansible_user=debian" playbook.yml --limit [hostname]`, for example `ansible-playbook -e "ansible_user=debian ansible_host=192.168.1.42" playbook.yml --limit laptopserver`
8. The machine is likely to reboot on first ansible run: be ready to enter disk decryption keys

## Encrypt Sensitive Files

```sh
# Encrypt the secret file
ansible-vault encrypt --vault-id @prompt secret.yml

# View the content of the secret file, will ask for password
ansible-vault view secret.yml

# Decrypt the content of the secret file, will ask for password
ansible-vault decrypt secret.yml
```

## Setup Wireguard using config from Ansible

Ansible should have installed and configured wireguard automatically.

However, if you would like to configure it manually:

```bash
# TODO: use Ansible to only generate the wg config file

# Install wireguard for your Linux distribution
sudo apt install wg

# Setup the connection using the config file generated by 'ansible-playbook playbook.yml' at /etc/wireguard/wg-ledetour.conf 
sudo wg-quick up wg-ledetour

#Confirm your virtual interface and peers are setup
sudo wg show
```

You can now ping other machines in the vpn according to the IPs specified in the file `hosts`.

If Ansible has added your public ssh keys to other machines in the wireguard network, you can now ssh into them using the username specified in the file `hosts`.

## Developement mode

A [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com) virtual machine can be used during development to safely test new configurations without modifying the production servers.

```sh
# Creates and run the virtual machines
vagrant up

# Run the Ansible playbook on the Vagrant virtual machine
vagrant provision
```

### Get ssh logging info

```sh
sudo grep sshd /var/log/auth.log
```

```sh
w
 12:42:14 up 1 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.06, 0.04, 0.01
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
vagrant  pts/0    10.0.2.2         12:41    1.00s  0.07s  0.00s w
```
